# Random Quote Generator

Project Overview:

The Random Quote Generator is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to receive a random inspirational, motivational, or thoughtful quote with every click of a button. The quotes are dynamically generated from a pre-defined list, providing a fresh and unique message each time.

The application is designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and easy to integrate into other websites or projects. It can be a fun tool for anyone looking for daily inspiration or a quick mental boost.
